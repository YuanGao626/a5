## Verification questions

In the "menus" folder of your project, you'll find dinner menus from seven of Cornell's dining
halls on Wednesday, March 26 (information from https://now.dining.cornell.edu/eateries). Use your
IndexerApp to answer the following questions about these menus.

1. Which dining halls were serving quinoa that night?

   Answer: TODO

2. On how many lines of North Star's menu does "chicken" appear?

   Answer: TODO

3. Only one dining hall was serving a sausage pizza. Which one?

   Answer: TODO

## Reflection questions

1. For a single source with N words of a fixed length, what is the expected asymptotic complexity of
   your `CollectionsIterator` solution in terms of N? (you will need to read the JavaDoc pages for
   the collections and methods you used in order to know their complexity claims)  Explain your
   reasoning.

2. What is the **worst-case** time complexity of TwoPassIndexer in terms of N, the total number of
   words across all files?  What algorithmic substitution would improve this worst-case complexity,
   and what would the new complexity be?
